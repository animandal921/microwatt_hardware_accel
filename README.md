#A System-on-a-Chip for Embedded Vision
## Overview
This System-on-a-Chip (SoC) will function as a low-power "smart eye" for detecting presence. It will process a video stream from a camera connected via its SPI interface to identify people or objects in real-time. The onboard Microwatt CPU will manage the system, while a dedicated hardware accelerator will perform the actual vision task using efficient classical algorithmsâ€”either background subtraction for general motion or a Haar Cascade classifier for specific objects. The SoC will then output a simple result (e.g., "person detected") via its UART interface, which will enable smart, on-device decision-making without a cloud connection, thus ensuring privacy and low latency.

## Architecture
The SoC will integrate a general-purpose CPU core with a specialized, fixed-function hardware accelerator. This architecture will allow each component to operate with maximum efficiency: the CPU will handle high-level control and decision-making, while the accelerator will perform the repetitive, high-throughput pixel processing.

The Controller: Microwatt CPU Core
The system will be managed by a Microwatt core, an open-source, 64-bit processor based on the OpenPOWER Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It will act as a lightweight system controller and will run a bare-metal C program to handle tasks such as:

Initializing the system and peripherals on startup.

Configuring the vision accelerator (e.g., setting the detection threshold).

Managing the flow of data from the camera to the accelerator.

Interpreting the simple, binary result from the accelerator to make a decision.

The Engine: Classical Vision Accelerator
The intensive vision processing will be offloaded to a custom classical computer vision accelerator. This versatile hardware block will be designed for efficiency and will operate in two modes:

Background Subtraction: For simple motion or change detection, it will use a highly area-efficient algorithm that is ideal for static scenes.

Haar Cascade Classifier: For more advanced tasks, such as specifically identifying a person or face, it will implement this robust, feature-based algorithm.

The Interfaces
The chip will communicate with the outside world using standard, low-pin-count interfaces:

SPI: Will be used to receive image data from an external camera module or sensor.

UART: Will provide a simple serial connection for debugging during development and for sending final detection results to a host system in production.

## Target Applications
This design will be ideal for high-volume, "set-and-forget" tasks where the primary goal is to detect a change in a static environment.

Smart Home & Office: Automatically control lighting, heating, or air conditioning when a person enters or leaves a room.

Simple Security: Trigger an alert or a separate high-resolution camera when motion is detected in a fixed area.

Industrial & Retail: Monitor a conveyor belt to confirm the presence of parts or check if a shelf in a smart vending machine is empty.
